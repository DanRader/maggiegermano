Happy Friday, y'all! Can you believe we only have one more week left in June? I can't, but I'm going on vacation next weekend, so I'm excited! Here's what I was up to this week.

## **How I Earned Money This Week**

* Last week was quiet on the business income front, but this week, the payments for three of my monthly clients went through.

* The June [Money Circle](https://www.maggiegermano.com/moneycircle/) meetup was this Wednesday, so the Eventbrite transfer is in route. I don't really consider Money Circle as an income source, as the funds usually are enough to cover snacks and materials, but every little bit counts!

* We also had four different sets of Airbnb guests this week. We're still going strong!

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* I donated $20 to [RAICES](https://www.raicestexas.org/), which is a Texas organization that is helping detained immigrants get legal representation so that they can be released and (hopefully) reunited with their children. I'm sick and disgusted over the treatment of these people, and I'm ashamed to be an American right now. If you can't afford to donate, make sure you're harassing your Senators and Representatives and letting them know they need to do something about this NOW. (Worried about who you're donating to? Check out [this piece](https://slate.com/business/2018/06/raices-can-be-effective-with-all-that-money-its-raising-on-facebook.html) about why RAICES is great.)

* We bought tickets to go see [Paramore](http://www.paramore.net/) at [Merriweather Post Pavilion](https://www.merriweathermusic.com/) this Saturday! I've loved Paramore since college, and after my sisters saw them perform in Syracuse this past weekend, I decided I needed to splurge on some tickets, as well. Hopefully it doesn't rain too much!

* I spent $15 on two travel guides from [Nomadic Matt](https://www.nomadicmatt.com/). There's so much to do in Thailand that I'm having trouble keeping track of it all. I figured the small expense would be worth it to have an organized guide on what to do in Bangkok and Thailand as a whole.

* We booked our hotel for the first two nights we'll be in Thailand! We're spending two days in Bangkok when we arrive, because we want to recover from our travel before heading south to the islands. We're spending quite a bit on the hotel in [Koh Lipe](http://kohlipethailand.com/), so we're trying to be frugal about our choices in the rest of Thailand. 

* I also bought a new bathing suit for my trip to the Dominican Republic next weekend. It was super cute and also very

## **What I’m Writing**

This week, I wrote about the difference between your credit score and your credit report. I also talked about why each of them is important. Make sure to [check it out](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/the-difference-between-your-credit-score-and-your-credit-report/)!

## **What I’m Excited About**

* We had a fantastic [Money Circle](https://www.maggiegermano.com/moneycircle/) gathering this week! The theme was budgeting and we all created our own budgets together. 

* I'll be voting as a Maryland resident for the first time next Tuesday, June 26th! 

* I’m offering [20% off one-time financial coaching sessions](https://maggiegermanofinancialcoaching.as.me/onetimediscount) in the month of June! We’re halfway through 2018, and this is usually the time we realize we haven’t made progress on our goals for the year. If you want some help getting back on track with your finances, let’s talk!

## **What I’m Up To**

* I'm voting in Maryland next Tuesday, June 26th! It's my first time voting as a Maryland resident, and I'm excited for it. It's the gubernatorial primary, with lots of other local primary elections. If you're a Maryland resident, make sure you [do your research](https://www.elections.maryland.gov/elections/2018/primary_candidates/index.html) over the weekend and [get to the polls](https://voterservices.elections.maryland.gov/PollingPlaceSearch) on Tuesday!

* I’m teaming up with [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/education/mo-money-mo-worries-get-financially-savvy-in-2018/washington-dc/49127) on Tuesday, June 26th for a free personal finance workshop in Navy Yard. See you there?

* The [July Money Circle meetup](https://www.maggiegermano.com/events/investing-101/) is live! We're bringing in expert Claudia Russell to talk about investing basics. Get your ticket and I'll see you on July 17th!
