I met with Maggie during a time of great transition - I was leaving my decades long, full-time, government job to start up my own organizing firm. I thought I had things figured out, but wanted to validate my financial plan with an expert who could also understand that my needs and decisions weren't just about the numbers, but also about my lifestyle and personality. Maggie totally got me and what I was trying to do! Not only did she give me objective support reviewing different fiscal issues, she went above and beyond to help me get the basics of my business, Declutter DC, started by linking me to several other DC-based resources that proved invaluable. I've already recommended Maggie to several other new small business owners and look forward to working with her more in 2017 as I move into the next phase of my own company.
