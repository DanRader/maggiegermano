I’m a 35-year-old, stay-at-home mom of 2 who manages our household’s financials, which includes 12 rental properties. We got started investing in real estate 5 years ago by moving out of the DC area, using the equity from our first home sale to purchase a new personal residence and our first 3 rentals. By the end of the next summer, we had 6 more cash flowing properties. Our aggressive investment in real estate helped set us up financially to get through a long and expensive infertility journey, and then allowed me to ‘retire’ from my financial management career of over 11 years with the Federal government. I currently manage our properties and share our investment experiences and money philosophies through onedollarallowance.com.
