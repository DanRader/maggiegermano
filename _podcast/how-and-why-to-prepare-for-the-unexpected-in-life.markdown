lede: In this episode, Maggie is chatting with Robin Young, the President of Northstar
  Financial Planning. They talk about Robin’s work helping women navigate life’s transitions,
  particularly sudden and unexpected life changes like a partner or family member
  dying, getting a divorce, or losing your earned income. They also talk about how
  you can prepare for and protect yourself just in case you find yourself experiencing
  one of these life events. It’s not always a happy topic, but it’s an important one
  to discuss.
