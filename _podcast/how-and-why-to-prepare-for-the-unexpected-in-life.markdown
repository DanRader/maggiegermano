  particularly sudden and unexpected life changes like a partner or family member
  dying, getting a divorce, or losing your earned income. They also talk about how
  you can prepare for and protect yourself just in case you find yourself experiencing
  one of these life events. It’s not always a happy topic, but it’s an important one

Particularly during periods of transition (retirement, loss of a spouse, inheritance, divorce, sale of a business) when life and money decisions are complicated. As a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ professional, Certified Financial Transitionist®, and a Registered Life Planner, Robin has the expertise on both the technical and personal sides of money to help clients successfully navigate life changes, make confident decisions and achieve a higher sense of personal and financial well-being.

There, she advised C-level executives at several Fortune 500 corporations, including Unum Provident, EMC and IBM.

In 2008, Robin assumed the helm at Northstar Financial Planning and her work in helping women in transition gained attention.
