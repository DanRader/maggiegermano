Co-Founders and Co-CEOs Katherine Salisbury and George Friedman had a growing family, and growing money stress. Keeping track of their finances from a traditional joint account proved impossible.

They needed a joint overview of all their finances, and they wanted to automate how their money moved to savings, investments, bills and spending accounts – but neither was possible with their bank setup. The idea for Qapital was born.

World-renowned behavioral economist Professor Dan Ariely joined soon after, and the team started building a suite of smart money tools that put people’s goals back at the heart of the way they bank. Today, Qapital combines behavioral science and the power of automation to help individuals and couples find money happiness and reach their life goals.
